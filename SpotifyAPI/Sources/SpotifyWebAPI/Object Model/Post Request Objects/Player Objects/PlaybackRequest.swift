 * context: The context in which to play the content. One of the following:
   * `contextURI(SpotifyURIConvertible)`: A URI for the context in which to play
     the content. Must be in one of the following categories:
     * Album
     * Artist
     * Show
     * Playlist
 
   * `uris([SpotifyURIConvertible])`: An array of track/episode URIs.
 
 * offset: Indicates where in the context playback should start. One of the
   following:
 
   * `position(Int)`: The index of the item in the context at which to start
     playback. Cannot be used if the context is an artist.
   *  `uri(SpotifyURIConvertible)`: The URI of the item to start playback at.
 
 * positionMS: Indicates from what position to start playback in milliseconds.
   If `nil`, then the track/episode will start from the beginning. Passing in a
   position that is greater than the length of the track/episode will cause the
   player to start playing the next item.
